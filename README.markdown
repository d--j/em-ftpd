# em-ftpd

A mini-FTP server framework built on top of the EventMacine gem. By providing a
simple driver class that responds to a handful of methods you can have a
complete FTP server.

The library is extracted from real world situations where an FTP interface was
required to sit in front of a non-filesystem persistence layer.

Some sample use cases include persisting data to:

* an Amazon S3 bucket
* a relational database
* redis
* memory

For some examples that demonstrate redis and memory persistence, check the
examples/ directory.

## The Driver Contract

To boot an FTP server you will need to provide a driver that speaks to your
persistence layer. The driver MUST have the following methods. Each method
MUST accept a block and yield the appropriate value:

    authenticate(user, pass, &block)
    - boolean indicating if the provided details are valid

    bytes(user, path, &block)
    - an integer with the number of bytes in the file or nil if the file
      doesn't exist

    change_dir(user, path, &block)
    - a boolen indicating if the current user is permitted to change to the
      requested path

    dir_contents(user, path, &block)
    - an array of the contents of the requested path or nil if the dir
      doesn't exist. Each entry in the array should be
      EM::FTPD::DirectoryItem-ish

    get_file(user, path, &block)
    - a string with the file contents at the requested path or nil if the
      user isn't permitted to access that path

    put_file(user, path, data, &block)
    - a boolean indicating if data was persisted to path

    delete_dir(user, path, &block)
    - a boolean indicating if the directory was successfully deleted

    delete_file(user, path, &block)
    - a boolean indicating if path was successfully deleted

    rename(user, from_path, to_path, &block)
    - a boolean indicating if from_path was successfully renamed to to_path

    make_dir(user, path, &block)
    - a boolean indicating if path was successfully created as a new directory

## Warning

FTP is an incredibly insecure protocol. Be careful about forcing users to authenticate
with a username or password that are important.

## Further Reading

There are a range of RFCs that together specify the FTP protocol. In chronological
order, the more useful ones are:

- [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt)
- [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt)
- [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2228.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2228.txt)
- [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2389.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2389.txt)
- [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2428.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2428.txt)
- [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3659.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3659.txt)
- [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4217.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4217.txt)

For an english summary that's somewhat more legible than the RFCs, and provides
some commentary on what features are actually useful or relevant 24 years after
RFC959 was published:

- [http://cr.yp.to/ftp.html](http://cr.yp.to/ftp.html)

For a history lesson, check out Appendix III of RCF959. It lists the preceding
(obsolete) RFC documents that relate to file transfers, including the ye old
RFC114 from 1971, "A File Transfer Protocol"
